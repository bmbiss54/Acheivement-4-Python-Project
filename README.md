Here are my first python scripts analyzing instacart data to show which market segments and right customer profiles instacart should target with a new marketing strategy. 
My Primary object with these scripts: Youâ€™re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
